                        During the initial stages of our early research outline, we provided several suggestions to be used for our research thesis that we were passionate about. But around this time, a sense of uncertainty came over me, I felt quite anxious about the work we were getting ourselves into. It was a tough choice, and they were all viable ideas for our field of research, however after thorough consideration and discussion with other experts on the matter, we decided on the topic of programming in child education. Our progress continued swimmingly as we produced arguments that advocated for introducing programming classes into child education. From my perspective, coming up with the points and elaborations was second nature to us as the notion of programming in classrooms seemed sensible. Although the challenge arose with our research as we looked for academic articles that supported our arguments and elaborations, it became apparent that there was a scarcity of research papers based on programming in children’s education. Fortunately, we did ultimately find the necessary sources to support our arguments, completing an early version of our outline. Now that we have gone halfway through our work, I feel confident that we have nothing to worry about as the area of difficulty in our research has already come to pass.

                        When this course first started, I didn’t give it much thought initially. This is because I simply had the idea it would be like every other English class I have had throughout my life. However, that assumption was quickly discarded. For this course, we will essentially gain our marks through researching a particular topic in a group of three to four. We then draft an outline based on it, write a written response and a research paper, and finally end with a portfolio that summarizes our progress. I initially thought this would be a breeze to go through, but as we learned more about how to write a proper and adequate research paper, I began to see the challenges and difficulties we had to navigate. While working on our outline, I quickly began to notice how finding a journal article that relates to your topic can be quite a challenge. The reason being, trying to find a journal article that passes the ‘CRAAP’ test while having no fallacies is scarce. Thus, a large amount of time needed to be spent in order to find appropriate materials. Furthermore, once we had accomplished our outline, we then had to do our written responses by merging the sources we had acquired to show our main points. Now, after completing half the work, I can say while it was considerably difficult, I have learned quite a substantial amount from this class being my researching skills and formal writing. Moreover, by browsing through many different articles, my own general knowledge has increased as well. I am proud we have made a significant amount of progress thus far, and I am hoping we can use the expertise we have acquired to complete both our research paper and portfolio.

                        Before I was introduced to the English course structure, I was piqued by the curiosity of what we were going to accomplish in this course. Is it a project involving a PowerPoint presentation? Is there a final examination to test our English comprehension? Or is it simply a 6-month marathon involving many English related course works? To my surprise, it involved writing a research paper, while simultaneously preparing us to work on our portfolio, which is the final project for this course. Initially, the instructions sounded fairly simple: form a group of 3 to 4 students, prepare a research topic, write a written response, compile the written response into a research paper, and finalize the paper into a portfolio. My expectations about writing the research paper were skewed; I thought that it was akin to writing some high school essay. Thus, I thought that the project was a walk in a park. Our mid-semester goal was finishing the written response; it turned out to have some hefty work involved. Firstly, the prerequisite of the paper being in argumentative form meant that it is important to have evidence and proof that back the claims my group and I have formulated. Finding such evidence is no easy task, especially for the topic we have finalized. During our work, it became apparent to our group that scholarly articles related to “programming” and “children’s’ education” are a rarity, especially if the papers must be published after 2020. Scouring through the library database for valid sources took hours upon hours to find. Secondly, the troublesome game of Spot the Difference when finalizing citations. There were many details to be particular about, and my eyes were strained heavily on this section of my work. Some of many the problems I encountered were omitted commas, erroneous capitalizations, misspelled author’s names, and obscure formatting rules; keeping it flawless was burdensome. Lastly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was more of a burden than a help. There were several occurrences where our group’s work was flagged as AI work, even when we ourselves did not depend on them. One example was when I submitted my final work for submission; upon review it was found to be fifty percent AI. I had to paraphrase my work from scratch in order for the submission to be of acceptable levels, which was twenty percent. In the end, my group and I managed to finalize the written response and accomplished our end goal for the mid-semester. It was a very hectic experience, and all of us submitted on the last day of the deadline. It was overall a bumpy journey, and a pleasure completing it.
